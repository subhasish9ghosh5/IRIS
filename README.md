## Introduction:

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains measurements of various iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as the species of each iris. This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of different iris species and to build predictive models for species classification.

## Dataset:

- The Iris dataset contains measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


- There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.


- Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples in the dataset.


- The dataset is balanced, meaning it contains an equal number of samples for each class.


## Explanation of columns:

- ID: This column likely represents a unique identifier for each entry in the dataset. It's used to distinguish one entry from another.

- SepalLength: This column represents the length of the sepal (a part of the flower) measured in some unit (possibly centimeters or inches).

- SepalWidth: This column represents the width of the sepal, usually measured in the same unit as the length.

- PetalLength: This column represents the length of the petal (another part of the flower), likely measured in the same unit as the sepal.

- PetalWidth: This column represents the width of the petal, typically measured in the same unit as the length and width of the sepal.

- Species: This column likely represents the species of iris flower corresponding to each entry in the dataset. This column is categorical and can take on values such as 'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor', or 'Iris-virginica'.
