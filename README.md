## Introduction:

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains measurements of various iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as the species of each iris. This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of different iris species and to build predictive models for species classification.

## Dataset:

The Iris dataset contains measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
-

There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
-

Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples in the dataset.
-

The dataset is balanced, meaning it contains an equal number of samples for each class.
