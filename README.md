## Introduction:

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains measurements of various iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as the species of each iris. This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of different iris species and to build predictive models for species classification.

## Dataset:

- The Iris dataset contains measurements of various characteristics of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


- There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.


- Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples in the dataset.


- The dataset is balanced, meaning it contains an equal number of samples for each class.


## Explanation of columns:

- ID: This column likely represents a unique identifier for each entry in the dataset. It's used to distinguish one entry from another.

- SepalLength: This column represents the length of the sepal (a part of the flower) measured in some unit (possibly centimeters or inches).

- SepalWidth: This column represents the width of the sepal, usually measured in the same unit as the length.

- PetalLength: This column represents the length of the petal (another part of the flower), likely measured in the same unit as the sepal.

- PetalWidth: This column represents the width of the petal, typically measured in the same unit as the length and width of the sepal.

- Species: This column likely represents the species of iris flower corresponding to each entry in the dataset. This column is categorical and can take on values such as 'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor', or 'Iris-virginica'.


# Summarizing the report findings, here are the results of the analysis :

## LINE PLOT

- Plot a line graph showing the sepal length of the three species of Iris flowers.

## Scatter Plot

- Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the petal length and petal width.Use different colors to represent each species.

## Histogram

- Plot a histogram showing the distribution of the petal widths. Use different colors to represent each species and display a legend.

## Bar Plot

- Create a bar plot showing the average sepal width for each species.

## Pie Chart

- Assume that the dataset represents the entire population of Iris flowers. Create a pie chart showing the proportion of each species in the population.

# Conclusion :

The Iris project serves as a foundational project in the field of machine learning, providing practitioners with hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and optimization. By successfully classifying iris flowers into their respective species, the project demonstrates the application of classification algorithms in real-world scenarios.
